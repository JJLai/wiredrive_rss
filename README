Example files for use with Wiredrive Media RSS Feeds

These example files are meant to be a starting place for developers to build websites on Wiredrive Media RSS feeds. The feeds allow developers to build sites using content hosted in Wiredrive. The example files address the most frequent implementation questions we have received.

Flash users:
If you want to pull the RSS feed into Adobe Flash, put /proxy/rss/cache.php onto your webserver and have Flash point to that file as the RSS feed URL. The cache script will copy the RSS feed from the Wiredrive CDN to your server and then serve it to the browser, thus eliminating the need for crossdomain.xml. 

See the Yahoo! Developer page on Cross-Domain requests for why this is necessary.

Code Folders:

/proxy/rss
cache.php imports the RSS feed to the local web server and then serves it to the browser. It is the easiest way to get around any cross site validation dependencies in Flash or Javascript. The contents of the RSS feed are in no way altered. The file accepts the feed as a paramater so the RSS URL does not have to be hard coded in the source.

development.php is the non-caching version of cache.php. We encourage users to use this file while developing the site, then switch to cache.php when going into production

/proxy/json
This folder is very similar to /proxy/rss examples. The difference in /proxy/json is that the RSS is converted to JSON before being sent to the browser. This example file also accepts a callback function as a parameter. When the callback function is specified, the JSON object is delivered as an argument to the specified callback.


Example Folders:

/example/javascript
This file contains three example layouts done entirely in Javascript and CSS. The examples convert the RSS feed to JSON data using the Google AJAX Feed APIs site. We feel that JSON is much easier to work with than XML in Javascript.  This is the example to start with if you are working on a server that does not allow any server side scripting.

See the Google AJAX Feed APIs for documentation about the conversion:
http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxfeeds/documentation/reference.html#JSON

/example/php
This file contains three example layouts done entirely in PHP and CSS. The RSS feed is converted to PHP objects using SimpleXML.

/example/workshop
Example site that used at the Wiredrive mRSS workshop.  The example uses code from /proxy/json to convert the RSS feed to JSON before it is loaded into javascript.
