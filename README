Example files for use with Wiredrive Media RSS Feeds

These example files are meant to be a starting place for developers to build websites on Wiredrive Media RSS feeds. The feeds allow developers to build sites using content hosted in Wiredrive. The example files address the most frequent implementation questions we have received.

Flash users:
If you want to pull the RSS feed into Adobe Flash, look at the json and xml examples.  They are the best starting point for importing the data into Flash. 

See the Yahoo! Developer page on Cross-Domain requests for why proxying the feed through your web server is necessary.
